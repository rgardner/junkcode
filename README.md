# Bob Gardner's Junkcode

This repo stores a collection of small algorithms, scripts, proof-of-concepts,
or just miscellaneous code I've written over the years (submodules may belong
to others).

I was inspired by a blog post or talk sometime in university to start this, but
I don't remember the source. From searching online, maybe it was [this talk by
Andrew Tridgell](https://www.samba.org/ftp/tridge/talks/junkcode.pdf).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```sh
python3 -m pip install pipx
python3 -m pipx install invoke
